We are going to use a functional test to verify the index method
returns a JSON payload with a list of Students.

We can use `HttpClient` from the Micronaut HTTP library. Import the
dependency into the `build.gradle`.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
...
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=micronaut-http-client]
}
----

We can invoke the controller actions by using the appropriate URL in the `HttpClient` API. We will get back a
`HttpResponse` object and with that object, we can validate the returned items of the controller.

The next feature method invokes the `index()` action and return a JSON list of students.

[source, groovy]
.src/integration-test/groovy/demo/StudentControllerIntSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/demo/StudentControllerIntSpec.groovy[indent=0]
----

<1> `.json` can be appended to the URL to declare we want a JSON response. 
<2> The JSON return type can be binded to a List of Maps.
<3> use the `HttpResponse` object to validate the status code, JSON Payload etc.

NOTE: `serverPort` property is automatically injected. It contains the random port where the Grails application runs during the functional test.
